# Nehebkau
An open-source 2D game engine made in python ... and on stream ![^1]

## How does it works ?
Nehebkau uses a unity-like structure with Scenes, GameObject and Component.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10
- That's it for now

## Where are we ?
- [X] Basic Objects
- [ ] Physics
   - [X] Basic movement (including basic forces and gravity)
   - [ ] Friction
   - [ ] Inertia (Rotations)
   - [ ] Collisions
- [ ] Input System
- [ ] Rendering[^2]

## Special thanks
Thanks @Louvtt for making a rendering pipeline for me !
